// BTR: oracle-priced multi-asset AMM. One protocol, one series across pool versions.
// Every fill emits one canonical `Swapped` event on the pool:
// `amounts` is packed `amountIn | amountOut << 128` and `fees` is `protoFee | lpFee << 128`. The
// whole fee is charged on the output leg, in `tokenOut` units; there is no input-leg fee and no
// separate fee-transfer transaction (source: dex-evm/src/interfaces/IPool.sol `Swapped`,
// dex-evm/src/libraries/PricingLib.sol `_settleAndPay`).
//
// Volume counts EVERY fill, including BTR's own coop-arbitrage fills. `Pool.swapCoop_cd` is
// callable only by addresses holding the COOP_ENABLED permission bit, which is granted only to
// BTR's own CoopArb contracts (protocol-owned atomic arbitrage). Those fills are real pool swaps:
// they move inventory against external venues and pay a non-zero LP fee, so excluding them left the
// whole series at zero while coop arb was the only flow. They are included here by the protocol's
// listing decision; the coop lane books a protocol fee of exactly zero, so a coop-only window shows
// volume and LP revenue with a protocol revenue of 0 (a measured zero, not a missing value).
//
// Fees vs revenue follows the DefiLlama convention (and Uniswap's own listing): `fees` is the whole
// swap fee the taker paid (LP share + protocol share), `revenue` is the protocol's share of it, and
// `supplySideRevenue` is the LP share. Uniswap reports swap fees as LP fees where its protocol fee
// is off, and protocol revenue only where a protocol fee is switched on; the two are the same
// identity, and a DEX with no protocol fee correctly reports zero revenue while its fees stay
// non-zero. BTR's protocol fee is switched on for public fills and zero on the coop lane.
//
// Liability conversions are volume too. `LiabilitySwapped` is emitted by `withdrawTo` when the
// LP exits into ANOTHER token than its claim (a cross-asset exit: the claim is converted through
// the same anchor-path quote a swap uses, then paid out) and by `swapLiability` (the claim is
// re-denominated into another leg, nothing paid out). Each is counted ONCE, on its output leg:
// - cross exit (`lpAmountOut == 0`): the pool's next `Withdrawn(sender, tokenOut, amount, 0)` in
//   the same transaction is the payout; `amount` of `tokenOut` is the volume, and that Withdrawn
//   is never counted again (a same-asset withdraw is liquidity, not volume);
// - `swapLiability` (`lpAmountOut > 0`): the minted claim's token value, `previewWithdraw` face
//   (amountOut + haircut) of `lpAmountOut` `tokenOut` shares at the window's end block.
// `LiabilitySwapped` carries the route fee (`fees`, route-only, tokenOut units), booked like a swap
// fee, protocol and LP shares apart; its `tolls`, like a swap's coverage toll, are not fees.
// Event shapes match dex-evm abi/events.json (Swapped, LiabilitySwapped, Withdrawn).
// Pools come from the PoolFactory contracts (official pools), resolved at the window's end block,
// so a new pool or factory generation needs no change here beyond a new factory address. The first
// generation stays listed: it keeps pre-v2 days resolving and holds its LPs' liquidity while it
// winds down. Both generations emit the same events.
